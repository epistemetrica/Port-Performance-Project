    "# AIS Data Ingestion \n",
    "\n",
    "Vessel locations data is ingested from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data available from the federal [Marine Cadastre website](https://hub.marinecadastre.gov/pages/vesseltraffic), and is processed in the following steps:\n",
    "- read data from the csv urls corresponding to each calendar day\n",
    "- drop unnessary columns\n",
    "- filter to only include cargo vessels\n",
    "- cast datatypes appropriately\n",
    "- save daily file to parquet\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- failed downloads are noted in print outputs\n",
    "- rows that would cause parsing errors (e.g., if there is an extra comma on one row) are skipped and are thus missing from the saved outputs. A warning is printed in the cell output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptions of each column of the raw data are available at the [AIS Data Dictionary](https://coast.noaa.gov/data/marinecadastre/ais/data-dictionary.pdf)."
